This was a group project carried out in 2020 in an attempt to answer a research question we selected based on the dataset we chose using kaggle.

Resarch question:
Is there a difference in the mean number of school absences between students who report different quality of family relationships(1 very bad - 5 excellent)?

The programs part of this project have already been run resulting in various files being created as part of the repo such as '.png' and '.pdf' that may be viewed.
Part of the repo can also be found the 'final_report.docx' which i wrote about the research question.
